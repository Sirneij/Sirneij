 Hi, I am John ðŸ‘‹! A selfless humanitarian and volunteer as well as an aspiring full-stack web developer with reasonable experience building and deploying, on Linux-based servers, Web Applications with Python (Flask and Django), HTML and CSS. I am a budding competitive Programmer with budding problem-solving skills using Python, C, JavaScript, Julia, and C++ on various online competitive Programming platforms such as HackerRank, and TopCoders. I have a passion for creating efficient customer-centric software solutions to complex problems. Ultimately, I solve real-world challenges by designing, building, and implementing end-to-end systems. Hence my active participation in various software development teams. I am very passionate about Software Development. I am always interested in solving problems regardless of industry. This passion has tilted my recent interest in creative Programming and Cloud computing, therefore, though I am open to being part of the team of Developers who use frameworks and tools to develop applications and solutions, I preferably want to be among those who develop these frameworks and tools so as to experience and be exposed to the nitty-gritty of creative coding.
